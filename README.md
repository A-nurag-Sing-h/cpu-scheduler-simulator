# Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator

**Course:** CSE 316: Operating Systems
**Project Type:** Academic Task-2 (CA Component)

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based simulator for various CPU scheduling algorithms. It allows users to input processes with arrival times, burst times, and priorities, and visualizes the scheduling execution in real-time.

## Features
- **Algorithms:** FCFS, SJF (Non-preemptive), Round Robin, Priority Scheduling.
- **Visualization:** Real-time simulation of the Ready Queue and CPU.
- **Metrics:** Automatic calculation of Average Waiting Time and Turnaround Time.
- **Gantt Chart:** Dynamic generation of the execution timeline.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Visualization Library:** Chart.js
